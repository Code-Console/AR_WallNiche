  "f1title": "1. Defining the profile position",
  "f1Desc": "Clamp the niche loose between the unmounted vertical wall profiles in your desired position and height.\nMeasure and note the size A and size B to relocate this position later again on the finished planked drywall.\nFind a more detailed description on our website and see the video instructions in this App to understand more easy.",
  "f2title": "2. Marking of Cutout template",
  "f2Desc": "After planking the drywall, mark the size A and B on it. In this way you have  worked out an indication point to determine the vertical profiles underneath. Draw a horizontal line, where you match the lower edge of the niche with the opening to the wall. Now you can transfer the complete niche outline to the wall with a pen. This is the template for the cutout in the next step.",
  "f3title": "3. Cutout for the niche",
  "f3Desc": "Cut along the outlines of step 2 into the upper walllayer. For double planked drywalls, the lower walllayer remains as mounting flange for the niche flange later on, see picture above. Remove the cutout.",
  "f4title": "4. Insert and attach the Slotfix wallniche",
  "f4Desc": "Insert the Sltofix wallniche into the cutout opening in the drywall. Attatch the niche to the wall using the included flat retainers and screws. On brick or concrete walls you can also use an appropriate gluing method.\nThe Slotfix wallniche is now ready mounted and prepared for the following work steps of sealing, preparatory work and surface. Enjoy your new interior feeling.",

  "help_txt": "Please note:\nTo use the AR-functionality (Augmented reality) a so called AR marker is required. Normally any QR Code (like the one on the Slotfix flyer) work. Fit the flyer-back or the cut-out QR Code plan to the wall (use a little piece of tape) where you want to see the virtual niche. In some cases (light conditions, smartphone adjustments and wall surface) a special AR marker is needed; you can find it easily via image search engine.\n Standing in the desired distance to the wall, hold the finger-tap-icon on the camera over the AR marker or QR Code and tap on it. The virtual niche will appear and you can examine it from different perspectives. View quality depends on above mentioned conditions.\nIn embedded mode you can merge the raw niche with a desired surface.To do that just move the camera (while you are in active viewing raw mode) to the respective surface so camera is filled out with it and tap once. Moving back to the niche you see the ready merged niche. You can do this consistently with any surface pattern you have\n\nIn other mode you can choose from different applicable surfaces like tiles and finery\nDecoration mode allows you to toggle a possible decoration setup\nillumination mode is not available yet\ndepending on the chosen niche type you can rotate the direction, move the middle part and toggle it.\nIn case of questions of problems pleae don't hesitate to contact us via info@brado-gmbh.de\nThank you very much for using the Slotfix app."
